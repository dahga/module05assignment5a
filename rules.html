    <title>Going to Boston- RULES: </title>

    <h1> Game Objective: </h1>
    <p>The object of the dice game is to win the most number of rounds, in an agreed-upon number of rounds. </p>

    <h2> Directions: </h2>
    <p>1. Each player (in turn) has three throws of the dice.<br> 2. On the first throw, the dice with the highest number rolled is put to one side. (If two or more of the dice show the highest number, only one is kept.)<br> 3. On second throw, the remaining
        two dice are thrown and once again, the highest-numbered dice is put aside. <br> 4. The final dice is then rolled. <br> 5. Add all three dice together. The sum of all three dice is the playerâ€™s score for that round. <br> 6. The player with the
        highest score wins the round. (Ties are broken by additional rounds of rolling.) <br> 7. When all rounds have been played, the player who won the most rounds is the overall winner
