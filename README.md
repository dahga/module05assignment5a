Homework 5a 

Description
Create a game between the computer and a player. The game must be a card game or a dice game and must used the provided card and dice images. You will post which card or dice game you plan to implement to the #claiming Discord
channel on the Discord server associated withthe class. It will be first come first served. You must claim one that no one else on that channelhas claimed. For a list of card or dice games,see the resources found at the end of this document.
You must use a MySQL database to store either game statistics or game history or game state (up to you which of those, possibly all, but at least one of those). You may use a framework such as https://laravel.com or any other PHP, JavaScript,
or CSS framework to accomplish this assignment.

Objectives: Review and reinforce knowledge of PHP learned so far. Also, provide a more realistic environment for you to use sessions, arrays, a database, and soon.

Directions:
Create a game between the computer and a player. The game can be anything you want.Those of you more skilled at programming
should take this opportunity to try to impress me. 

For those of you less skilled, you don’t have to go overboard in terms of complexity. The first thing you should do is prompt the player for their name. 

This is to be a game you create yourself. Previously, a number of students did copy and paste a hangman game from the web. That didn’t work out very well for them. I can do web searches too.

As always, provide navigation buttons and alsoa button in each program to display the source
code. 

In your source code, provide lots of comments to show that you actually understand what you’re writing. If you are inspired by other code, be sure to cite your sources in comments in your source code. 

You may make your own game that uses dice and/or playing cards, but if you do, I encourage you to keep it simple so that you have a chance to realistically complete it. Also, to claim the game, you must post a final and complete set of rules for your game to the #claiming channel (by complete, I mean that two people who have never played the game before could realistically be expected to be able to understand the rules and play between each other using just dice/cards, the rules you wrote, and no computer of any sort and no clarification from you and not get confused about how to play). 

Keep all these games kid-safe, family-friendly, and free from anything that you wouldn’t realistically expect to see in a G-rated movie. (I may outsource the grading of this assignment to my family.)

You will need to have an option for me to see thecode.

Be sure to put your database password in a separate password.php file which you include, so that when you show the code to me I don’t see it.

You MAY work in groups. If you choose to do so, then the following rules apply:

• Groups, and members of groups, are not eligible for the extra credit.

• Groups must use Git to work together.

• You must clearly articulate who has what role, what the roles are, and everyone must sign off on the role assignment sheet - which should be linked to from your assignment.

• Each submission to the assignment folder on D2L Brightspace must indicate what group they were part of.

• All students in the group must have their own complete copy of the assignment, in their own private directory, linked to from their own index.html. One student at random will be chosen from the group and their assignment copy will be the one that will be graded and applied to everyone else in the group.
